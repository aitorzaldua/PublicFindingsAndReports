## [H1] FFi is enabled and running commands on auditors' computers

### Severity

High Risk

### Date Modified

Dec 6th, 2023

### Summary

Foreign Function Interface, aka ffi, is a cheat code that executes commands in our computer as if it were the owner. You should never run this type of test without knowing what is happening.

In this case, at the very moment we run `make` we run every test so, by default, we will be pwned!

### Vulnerability Details (PoC)

After run `clone` and `make`:

:-( ups.

With the test testPwned() We run the instruction touch and have created the file youve-been-pwned

### Impact

In this case, the elves were just being naughty, but a malicious developer could use this kind of test to control or destroy our computer.

### Tools Used

Manual, foundry

### Recommendations

Always check all code distributed by a customer, especially the tests. Then, if you find something suspicious, you can "comment" it and ask the developers for an explanation.

```
/*
* What is that???

function testPwned() public {
    string[] memory cmds = new string[](2);
    cmds[0] = "touch";
    cmds[1] = string.concat("youve-been-pwned");
    cheatCodes.ffi(cmds);
}
*/
```
